# Odin-binary-search-tree

In this project I built a balanced binary search tree. I also provided 
many methods to the factory 'Tree' function that allow the following:

* Inserting new nodes into the tree
* Deleting existing nodes from the tree
* Finding a node with a given value
* Displaying the nodes in an array in level order, inorder, preorder and postorder
* Displaying the tree height (number of edges in longest path from root node)
* Displaying the depth of a given node (number of edges to root node from given node)
* Determining if the tree is balanced 
* Rebalancing the tree
